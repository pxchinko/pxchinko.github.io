            <h2>about:</h2>
				<p>A graduate student pursuing his passion in linguistics, Calvin Tang finds himself continually transfixed on new hobbies, which include language, photography, and motorcycles. Growing up in Torrance, California, he found himself studying in San Francisco, but with an itch to travel and continue his self-taught French lessons, studied abroad for a year in Southern France. He is currently attending school in Long Beach for his master's degree in linguistics. After graduating, he plans on applying his academic skills to computational linguistics.</p>

    <div class="container" id="language">
         <div class="image"><img src="Images/language.png" alt="language" border="0">

            </span>
             <h3>language:</h3>
				<p>With his master's focus and bachelor's being in linguistics, language is an obvious and continuous passion of Calvin's as he analyzes language on a daily basis. After studying for years and a year-long study abroad trip to Marseille, France, he became fluent in French, speaking in the Southern French accent native to the region he studied. Being surrounded by different languages in his younger years but never being formally educated spurred a pursuit to further educate himself with languages, breaking them down to its very basic structure.</p>
             <h4 id="photography">photography:</h4>
                <p>Though his educational focus is on language, one of Calvin's favorite hobbies is street photography. With one of his favorite photographers and greatest influences being Fan Ho, he emulates this influence and focuses on mundane scenes to make them appear extraordinary. Calvin also has a small collection of film and digital cameras, the main two camera bodies being a Sony A72 and Olympus 011.</p>

        <h5>motorcycles:</h5>
                <p>Once he graduated with his bachelor's and moved away from San Francisco, Calvin found his third passion, motorcycles. After receiving his motorcycle license, he bought his first motorcycle, a red 2001 Suzuki SV650, lovingly named "Rat Bike". He enjoyed all its quirks and follies until recently deciding to invest in a newer and more reliable vehicle, a blue jewel-toned Triumph America.</p>
